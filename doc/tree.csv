Branch Name,Expanded name,Physical Description,Comment
dem,Downstream electron,reconstruction info interpreting the track as an electron moving downstream,"This is the main TrkAna branch for OnSpill loop helix fit tracks.  When TrkAna is run on cosmic rays fit  with the Kinematic Line fit, the main branch will be called 'kl', and all subsequent branches 'kl*'"
demmc,Downstream electron MC truth,Simlulation (Monte Carlo) information pertaining to the true particle most closely associated with (ie producing the most hits used in the fit) the reconstructed track described in the de branch,
demtsh,Downstream electron track straw hits,Detailed information about individual straw hits associated with this track,produced with diagLevel>1
demtshmc,Downstream electron track straw hit MC truth,"Detailed simulation (Monte Carlo) information about the particle\nwhich generated the corresponding (same index) hit used in the track fit, at the position and time associated with that sensor.  Note that the detshmc branch length can be longer than the detsh branch, as it includes information about hits generated by the principle true particle associated with this track that were not used in the track reconstruction",produced with diagLevel>1
demtch,Downstream electron track calo hit,Detailed information about individual calorimeter cluster hits used when fitting this track,produced with diagLevel>1
demtchmc,Downstream electron track calo hit MC truth,"Detailed simulation (Monte Carlo) information about the particle which generated the corresponding (same index) hit used in the track fit, at the position and time associated with that sensor.",produced with diagLevel>1
evtinfo,Event Info,General information about the event containing this track,
evtinfomc,Event Info Monte Carlo,General simulation (Monte Carlo) information about this event,
hcnt.,Hit Count,Counts of hits used in reconstructing this track with various filters,
tcnt.,Track Count,Number of tracks of different types reconstructed in this event,
demfit,Downstream electron fit samples,"Information about the track fit sampled at various locations (tracker entranc, middle, exit, etc).  See  SurfaceId  for details.  Locations correspond (mostly) to Virtual Detectors","Not every true particle intersects all 3 of the virtual detectors used to define these branches, so some tracks may be missing some of these"
"demlh (demch, demkl)",Fit parameters,"Fit parameters and errors, sampled at the same locations (same index) as demfit.  Only one of these branches will be present, depending on what data TrkAna processed",
demtsm,Downstream electron straw material,Information about the straw material intersected by this track,Only present for detail>1 processing
demmcsim.,Downstream electron Monte Carlo simualtion information,"Simulation Information about particles that generated hits used to fit the track, and its predecessors",
demmcvd,Downstream electron Monte Carlo Virtual Detector information,Simuation information about the properties of the true particle associated with this track sampled at various virtual detectors.,
crvhit,Crv hit information,Information about individual Crv hits (coincidence clusters) in the event,
crvhitmc,Crv hit MC information,Information about MC true particles associated with individual Crv hits listed in crvhit,
